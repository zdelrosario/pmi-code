# Worked Example

The notebook in this directory documents a worked example calculation of a
precision materials index (PMI). There are two (important) files in this
directory:

- `calc_pmi.Rmd`: Source code for worked example.
- `calc_pmi.md`: Rendered notebook for easy viewing on GitHub; click on the file to see a human-readable preview of the notebook.

## Dependencies

- The `.Rmd` notebook relies on the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data wrangling.
  - I recommend [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) as a convenient way to work with Rmarkdown files.
